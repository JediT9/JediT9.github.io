<h2>The game download of the website is giving me a "network failed" error
A network failed error is usually caused by a google chrome glitch, to fix this error, start.<br>
by changing to a different browser.  If this doesn't solve the problem, then it is probably<br>
being caused by your anti-virus.  If this is the case, try turning it off and retrying the <br>
download.<br>
